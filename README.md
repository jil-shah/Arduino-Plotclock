# Arduino-Plotclock
Code used for PlotClock Project, it is a mechanical device that plots the time using a marker on a small white board in C.

The code accurately uses x,y,z coordinates to determine the position of the marker and draws on the board.
Uses a calibration code at the beginning to align the marker to the corner of the working space - this is because the working space determines where the marker will draw in and scale the drawing depending on the size.
